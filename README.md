### About

The app was created in 2022 during my second year at Haaga-Helia UAS, Helsinki. The theme is a fictional personal trainer platform, which uses data sourced from APIs. Users can view, edit and delete customers and their training sessions. The app was created using JavaScript, React, HTML, and it is ran within the users web browser.
